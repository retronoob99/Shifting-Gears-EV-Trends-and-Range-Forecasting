# 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the shift toward sustainable transportation by analyzing the adoption trends of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) across Washington State. Using real-world electric vehicle registration data, the analysis uncovers geographic, manufacturer, and performance-based insights, along with a predictive machine learning model.

The goal of this project is to understand market trends, policy impact, and key drivers behind EV adoption while demonstrating end-to-end data analysis and modeling skills.
